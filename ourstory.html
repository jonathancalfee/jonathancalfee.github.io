<p> Jenny and I first met online using the website "Coffee Meets Bagel".
  After texting back and forth for a few days we decided to spend some time getting to know each other over a common mutual interest - wine.
We had our first data here at Lush Wine Bar on Chicago. Jenny - fresh off drinks with fiends was significantly less nervous then Jonathan, who was stone sober (and as would become a trend) was also right on time.
Jonathan forgave Jenny for being late as she was one of the most amazing people he'd ever met. </P>

<p> Jenny and I then started dating and after about 6 months they decided they were ready to take a big next step
and move in together. Jenny and Jonathan then moved into Jenny's condo at 1122 N. Clark street. Starting with the Polar Vortex
of 2014 (a real test as Jenny hates the cold) and then moving into the middle of 2014, Jonathan decided to sell his old condo
and move in permanently. Jenny learned to deal with his clutter and his love of sports because Jonathan was cute and made sure
she was on time to things. </P>

<p> On March 20th 2015, Jonathan worked up the courage to ask Jenny to marry him. After much deliberation (kidding) Jenny said yes.
  The story (too long to post here) centered around a new washing machine, Jenny doing Yoga without telling Jonathan and Jonathan
  pacing around the apartment with a ring box in his pocket. Finally though they were engaged and could tell their parents. Jenny's
  mother was overjoyed, however she was very mad at Jenny's father for not telling her as Jonathan had asked for his permission over
  Christmas break. They met their friends at Lush where they hda their first date to celebrate their new engagement.  </P>
